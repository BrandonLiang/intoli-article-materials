# Scraping User-Submitted Reviews from the Steam Store

[Scraping User-Submitted Reviews from the Steam Store](https://intoli.com/blog/steam-scraper/) is a Scrapy tutorial that we produced in conjunction with our friends over at [Scraping Hub](https://scrapinghub.com/).
It explores building an advanced Scrapy spider that involves bypassing access checkpoints on the [Steam's website](steampowered.com) in order to download user reviews.
The full code of the scrapers can be found in the [steam-scraper](https://github.com/prncc/steam-scraper) repository.
